### Why MiddReddit

MiddReddit addresses the need for a online community to discuss Middlebury-centric topics, such as:

1. Courses
2. Social Scene
3. Athletics
4. Extracurriculars
   
Currently, few online communities exist to fill this role. This will allow students to stay up to date on what is happening on campus, provide support during stressful times, and be a good platform to fall back on to stay in touch with the Middlebury community when on breaks.

## Creation

This project skeleton has been setup similar to our assignments and practicals. It is a Next.JS application, created with create-next-app `ðŸ’» npx create-next-app@latest`, which uses Jest and Testing Library for testing, ESLint for static analysis, Prettier for styling, and is configured to use GitHub actions for testing pull requests.

Development dependencies installed with:

```
ðŸ’» npm install -D jest jest-environment-jsdom husky lint-staged prettier eslint-config-prettier @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom
```

### Additional tools you might need
All that is needed is a Middlebury Username and password to create a MiddReddit account.

#### Mocking fetch

Tools for mocking fetch can be installed with

```
ðŸ’» npm install -D fetch-mock-jest node-fetch@2.6.7
```

Note we need to pin the `node-fetch` version due to breaking changes when used with Jest in newer versions.
