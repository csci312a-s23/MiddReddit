### Why MiddReddit

MiddReddit addresses the need for a online community to discuss Middlebury-centric topics, such as:

1. Courses
2. Social Scene
3. Athletics
4. Extracurriculars

Users can post, comment, and upvote to contribute to discussion. Viewing posts and comments is open to the public, but any actions require a middlebury.edu email.  

## Local Installation

For authentication, a `.env.local` file is required in the project's root directory.  This is populated with three things a Google Client ID, Google Client Secret, and a NextAuth Secret. Example:

```
