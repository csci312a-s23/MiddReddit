### Why MiddReddit

MiddReddit addresses the need for a online community to discuss Middlebury-centric topics, such as:

1. Courses
2. Social Scene
3. Athletics
4. Extracurriculars

Users can post, comment, and upvote to contribute to discussion. Viewing posts and comments is open to the public, but any actions require a middlebury.edu email.
